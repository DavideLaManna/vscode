    "text": "General Description: The D1022S or D1022D is a loop-powered single or dual channel isolated current repeater. It can be used to interface transmitter, to drive I/P converter, fire and \nsmoke detectors or similar switched resistor systems, located in Hazardous Area, requiring a wide output current range (from 1 to 40 mA) to operate properly. When drive I/P converter, \npositioner, display a current source is connected to the input terminals, while interfacing transmitter or fire and smoke detector a voltage source with current readback can be \nconnected. The transmitter current is sinked from the input terminals operating as a transparent interface. For fire and smoke detector, the triggering of a detector causes a \ncorresponding change in the Safe Area circuit current. A field open circuit reflects a high impedance to the control device circuit. \nThe unit has reverse input polarity protection and \u2264 1 % accuracy. \nFunction: 1 or 2 channels I.S. analog current repeater for transmitters, I/P converter or fire-smoke detectors providing input-output isolation. \nEMC: Fully compliant with CE marking applicable requirements. \n",
